## Current Status & Challenges

### üöß What We're Working On

**Authentication System (0% Complete)**
This is our biggest blocker right now. We need to:
- Implement Firebase Authentication
- Create login/register forms
- Add password reset functionality
- Set up social login options

**Course Management (0% Complete)**
We have the UI ready but need the backend:
- Design course data structure
- Create content management system
- Implement progress tracking
- Add assessment functionality

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Blockers

1. **No User Authentication** - Users can't sign up or log in yet
2. **No Course Content** - We have the interface but no actual courses
3. **No Payment System** - Can't monetize the platform yet
4. **Limited Testing** - Need comprehensive test coverage

---

## What's Next (6-Week Roadmap)

### Phase 1: User Management (Weeks 1-2)
**Priority: Critical**

We need to get users on the platform:
- Set up Firebase Authentication
- Build login/register forms
- Create user profile management
- Implement protected routes

**Expected Outcome:** Users can create accounts and access the platform

### Phase 2: Course System (Weeks 3-4)
**Priority: Critical**

Transform our beautiful UI into a functional learning platform:
- Design course data schema
- Build course creation tools
- Implement progress tracking
- Add video/audio content support

**Expected Outcome:** Complete course management system

### Phase 3: Monetization (Weeks 5-6)
**Priority: High**

Start generating revenue:
- Integrate Stripe for payments
- Create subscription management
- Build checkout flow
- Add payment history

**Expected Outcome:** Revenue-generating platform

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **Authentication Complexity** - Firebase Auth can be tricky to implement correctly
2. **Payment Integration** - Stripe integration requires careful security considerations
3. **Content Management** - Need to design scalable course structure

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Performance** - 3D components might impact mobile performance
2. **AI Costs** - Need to monitor API usage and costs
3. **Testing Coverage** - Limited tests could lead to bugs

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with simple authentication, add social login later
- Use Stripe's test mode for development
- Implement proper error handling and fallbacks
- Set up monitoring for AI API usage
